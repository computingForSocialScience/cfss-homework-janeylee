Hi,

Thanks for all your help with this project in person and on Piazza, but unfortunately I was only able to complete up to 2.1, so I got all the meta data and table data into my sql database. I wanted to compare household income to average commute time (I originally planned on looking at health insurance coverage by veteran status, but the relevant tables were all cross tabbed already, making it confusing to extract the data). I  made some attempts at 2.2, and it seems like my 'join' statement executed, though it took an extremely long time (I think about 40-50min). I was confused as to  how to make the x and y axes and provide the summary statistics after joining the two columns, so this part is blank in my code. I also tried to make a skeleton of the html file with the Bokeh graph, in the event that I could get the data in, but I didn't make it to that step. 

How to run the code: 
1. Run database.py to populate the tables. collectData.py has functions for downloading table info and table data, and is already imported into database.py.
2. Run app.py.
